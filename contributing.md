Thank you for your interest in adding to dataisreal.org. Please follow the instructions on this page.

## Jekyll

We use Jekyll to format posts. Refer to [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for instructions of how to post.

The filename should be `[date in YYYY-MM-DD]-[title].md` and the file should include a header.

At a minimum the header of the file should include:
* `title`
* `date`
* `author` with your real name or a pen name
* at last one entry in `categories`

Optionally you may include:
* `author-website` with an absolute URL including the protocol.

Add new posts to [GitHub Pages Repo](http://github.com/dataisreal/dataisreal.github.io).

## Show your work.

We want to build the reputation of having solid, evidence-based, information on this blog. For that reason we require you
provide your work so that it can be independently reviewed. Please follow these guidelines:
* In addition to your blog post, you should post any files or code you wrote that computes the graphs and charts that you 
publish in your article.
* Articles that don't also share their work will not be published.
* You can use any file, language, etc. you want as long as it is in an open and accessible format. Ideally you'll write code 
that generates graphs, charts, CSV files, etc., but we will also accept OpenOffice (or similar open format file) spreadsheets 
or Excel (since most spreadsheet software can open Excel). 
* Please try to document your code or files so that they are easy to understand and include a `README.md` file with instructions 
for building the code and downloading requirements.
* In your commit(s) to the [data repository](http://github.com/dataisreal/data) either include your resources (code, files, etc.) in the commit or a link to the location 
where they can be found.
  * Code added to this repo should be in its own root directory, isolated from any other code.
  * The directory should be named `[publish date in YYYY-MM-DD]-[name of post]`
  * The actual publish date will be unknown, but forward date it a few days. We'll change it when we merge it in.
* Code doesn't have to be built in Linux, but it should be able to run there, if not on Mac and Windows as well.
* Include a link to the corresponding code as a reference in your post.

## References

The policy for publishing is to:
* use as many reliable sources as you can reasonably find.
* always site what we have (even if it doesn't corroborate what we've presented).
  * Provide an author, title, publication date, and URL if possible, as well as any descriptions or disclaimers you'd like to indicate.
* always second guess (and third guess) our conclusions.
* present multiple sides of a debate.

## Promoting Products

Promoting products is not encouraged, however, if you read an excellent book about math, politics, or a field that relies 
on statistics and you write a review of that book, that's great. Just keep it tasteful and don't oversell anything.
What does "tasteful" mean? Among other things, it means it doesn't sound like a sales pitch.

## Affiliate Links

We post affiliate links for various books and products. You are welcome to use those. If you have your own affiliate links,
you may use those in addition to or instead of ours. If you choose to split between the two, that's great.
Basically, affiliate links are okay as long at it doesn't violate our "promoting products" section.

* Please refrain from any profanity.
* Use attractive graphs. If it's ugly we won't accept it.
* Feel free to use any dialect of English you want.
* We may ask you to revise and resubmit your work to fix mistakes or for other reasons.
