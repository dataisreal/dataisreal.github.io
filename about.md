# About dataisreal.org

Welcome to dataisreal.org. We publish interesting graphs and charts that use reliable, unbiased data in a neutral way.

## FAQ

**Are you politically neutral?**

We post about political topics, but we try to be politically neutral. We have political preferences (like everyone does) but we try to refer to the data as much as possible. We are not endorsed or sponsored by any party or politician.

**Where do you get your data?**

We publish all our resources on every blog post.

**I'd like to contribute, how can I?**

Please submit a pull request. If it meets our standards we will publish it. Please be sure to follow the [instructions here](/contributing).

**"Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics"?**

Yup. Uncovering the truth is hard. We can't claim to be infallible, but we can try to:
* have multiple reliable sources.
* always site what we have (even if it doesn't corroborate what we've presented).
* always second guess (and third guess) our conclusions.
* present multiple sides of a debate.

**Can you do a post on \[insert fascinating topic you must know more about here\]?**

Possibly. Reach out to us on Twitter at [@dataisreal_org](https://twitter.com/dataisreal_org).

**Can I sponsor a post?**

Absolutely. We will maintain our strict non-bias policy and we will clearly identify you as the sponsor. Reach out to us on [@dataisreal_org](https://twitter.com/dataisreal_org) for more information.

**Money?**

Yes please. ;)

While we don't have ads on our blog, we do use some affiliate links. We disclose this when applicable.

**You don't post very often. Why not?**

Most of us are full-time employees, parents, students, or all of the above.

**Are you aware that "_data_" is a plural noun and so "data _is_ real" is grammatically incorrect?**

Of course! What kind of self disrespecting data nerds do you think we are? However, colloquially "data" is also used as a collective noun (much like "information") and so depending on context we will treat it as such, if you want to start "dataarereal.org" feel free (or, hey, forward it to our site).
